Think of Docker containers as little virtual machines that run specific applications. When you start a Docker container, it needs to know which application to run inside it. That's where the "entrypoint" comes in.

Docker entrypoint is like a default command that runs when you start a container. It tells Docker what should be the main thing the container does.

Here are some examples to help you understand:

Suppose you have a simple Python script called "hello.py" that prints "Hello, Docker!" to the console.

Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3
COPY hello.py /app/hello.py
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/app/hello.py"]
```

Build and run the container:

```bash
docker build -t my-container .
docker run my-container
```

When you run this container, it will execute the "hello.py" script, and you'll see the output:

```
Hello, Docker!
```
